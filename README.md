# Cancer Classifier using CNN ðŸŒŸ

## Description

This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying biological data, specifically cancer images. ðŸ“¸

## Research Question 
What is the best format to create models to classify cancer cells for diverse cell types? 

## Goal ðŸŽ¯

The primary objective of this project is to create a model capable of accurately classifying cancer cells with an 80% accuracy rate, based on the provided dataset. ðŸ§¬

## Data ðŸ“Š

The dataset consists of images sourced from Kaggle: [Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images?resource=download). It includes five categories:

1. **Lung benign tissue** ðŸ¦ 
2. **Lung adenocarcinoma** ðŸ¦ 
3. **Lung squamous cell carcinoma** ðŸ¦ 
4. **Colon adenocarcinoma** ðŸ¦ 
5. **Colon benign tissue** ðŸ¦ 

## Project Status ðŸš€

### Progress

I have successfully set up the data pipeline and model. Currently, the model achieves 90% accuracy in classifying colon cells as cancerous or non-cancerous. However, the challenge lies in classifying lung cells due to their diverse types and various cancers. I am currently exploring different hyperparameters to improve lung cell classification. ðŸ’¡

## Future Work ðŸ”®

Moving forward, I plan to test various model configurations and combine the best parameters to create a tuned model. Evaluating accuracy will be crucial to assess any improvements achieved. ðŸ“ˆ
